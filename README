If the user chooses 'P', he/she will be asked to choose a level to play (0-9).Player should press the num_key of the level he/she wants to play.

* Brown boxes are walls and are impassable. These boxes cannot be moved/pushed or be replaced by other boxes.
* Black boxes are spaces where the player is allowed to move around in.
* Blue areas are storage areas where the pink boxes should be moves/stored to. These areas cannot be moved but are passable.
* Pink boxes are movable boxes that can be pushed to occupy the blue areas. Pink boxes can only be PUSHED and NOT PULLED.
* The green box is the player and is movable as long as it is not blocked. Player can move/push by using the keys 'W,A,S,D' (up,down,left,right). 
* Purple boxes are pink boxes that have been stored in the blue areas. These boxes can be moved/pushed as well, but when they leave their blue area they revert back to their pink state.

GOAL: Move all pink boxes towards the blue storage locations. TURN ALL PINK BOXES PURPLE!
